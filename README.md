# CEACStatusBotðŸ¤–

[æŸ¥çœ‹ä¸­æ–‡æ–‡æ¡£](README.Chinese.md)

Automatically check your U.S. visa application status in [CEAC](https://ceac.state.gov/CEACStatTracker/Status.aspx?App=NIV) and notify you instantly when it updates! 

## Usage

You can deploy it to your own machine, but it is highly recommended to use Github Actions. 

### Environment Variables

- LOCATION: the location where you applied for your visa. To find the corresponding location name for the embassy, please refer to [this table](LOCATION.md). Use the embassy location name directly, such as `CHINA, BEIJING`.

- NUMBER: your Application ID or Case Number help icon (e.g., AA0020AKAX or 2012118 345 0001) 

- PASSPORT_NUMBER: your passport number

- SURNAME: first 5 Letters of surname

- TIMEZONE: optional, set your timezone to avoid disturbing during sleep. :-) Some example: `Asia/Shanghai` `America/New_York`

- GH_TOKEN: to access previous status, you need to set a Github token with `repo` scope. You can create a new token in Github -> Settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access tokens.

#### Notification by Email

Add the following env variables if you want to send notification by email.

- FROM: the email address you use to send the notification.

- TO: the email address you want the notification sent to. You can send to more than one email, split the email address with "|" and without space. Here is an example: `first@email.com|second@email.com|third@email.com`

- PASSWORD: the password of the `FROM` email. Notice: for some email, such as QQ Mail, you should use "authorization code" instead of your password here, because this repo use SMTP to send email. Check the SMTP usage of your Mailbox Service Provider for more details.
